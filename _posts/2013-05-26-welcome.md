This is my first post on the site. The "Software Gardener" project was incubating for some time, and finally
i have come to creating it. Of course blogging is so mainstream now, that it is nothing really extraordinary.
But i simply need some place where I will dump some of my thoughts and maybe share it with others in some more
persistent way than a twitter or facebook post.

Few words about me (of course) can be found at [About Me]({{BASE_PATH}}/about_me.html) page.

The blog is about pretty much everything that affects software engineers, not only coding. I believe that really good 
software engineer should focus mostly on coding but also should embrace all the 
tasks that can help to make the main, coding task happen.
