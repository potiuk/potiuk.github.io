I am a software engineer 
and it's deeply rooted in my internal fabric. Even after many years of working in the industry, and playing various 
roles - software engineering is the base 
and pretty often most of what I am doing in those roles. I am currently CTO and Partner of 
[Polidea](http://www.polidea.pl), but big part of my tasks are software engineering tasks. Software engineering in 
the modern and pretty wide sense of it. It's not only coding (though that's the essence of it and I know I will 
never give up coding), but also all the surrounding activities which are necessary to do in our work to be successful. 
Those activities are usually connected with sharing, mentoring, organizing community, and tech leading of 
engineering teams, as well as maintaining customer relationships and leading some of the project's efforts. 
Those tasks are equally satisfying and interesting for me but I would never
think about doing them on their own - they are mostly supportive for any kind of engineering and coding activity -
whether done by myself, or people who are working with me (mind, I raarely get people working FOR me, usually they
work WITH me). The values of [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)
guide my choices when it comes to software engineering.

I am a firm believer in people's versatility, and generally understood agility, however without going the
super-orthodox way. I think the main task of an engineer is to pick the best tool for the job (as opposed 
to finding nails if you hold a hammer). While I love to work in agile environments, which are genereally 
closer to my personal way of organizing projects, I understand also that there are project which should better
be done in a less agile way and with more emphasis on planning. Similarly as for software engineering, 
[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) guide my choices when it comes to software project leading and 
organization.

Currently I am focusing on mobile software development - including connected devices as the most recent trend. Except
of being CTO in [Polidea](http://www.polidea.pl), I am also co founder of [Diamond Polishing](http://www.szlif.edu.pl) 
Academy of Engineering and [Mobile Warsaw](http://mobile-warsaw.pl) initiative. I am happy to help in building the
community of professionals in Warsaw, Poland and beyond. 
Occassionally I [present]({{BASE_PATH}}/presentations.html) at conferences or meetups.

See also my answer in Quora for the question: [Do people loose interest in programming as they age](http://qr.ae/pMxmv)
that reflects pretty well my views on programming in general.
