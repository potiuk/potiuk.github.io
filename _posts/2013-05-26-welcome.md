This is my first post on the site. The software-gardener project has been on my mind for some time, and finally
i have come to creating it. Of course blogging is so mainstream now, that it is nothing really extraordinary.
But i simply need some place where I will dump some of my thoughts and maybe share it with others in some more
persistent way than twitter or facebook post.

Few words about me (of course) can be found at [Main Page]({{site.production_url}}/)

The blog is about pretty much everything that can be interesting for software engineer - since I believe a good 
engineer shoudl focus in big part on coding but also should be open to everything that surrounds it and embrace the 
parts that can help with the main, coding tasks.
